## Setup

Before you start, install all dependencies and create `.env.local` file which is .gitignored and used for local dev.

```
yarn
cp .env.example .env.local
```

You need postgres running locally (with correct credentials & database available). The easiest way to get a postgres db with the right credentials up&running is via `docker-compose.yml` file. Check the readme in the root of this repo.
